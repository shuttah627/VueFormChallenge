As per other coding challenges I have faced in the past, I have given myself an artificial 2hr time limit to finish the tasks. Not everything was completed, but 8/11 steps on my ThingsToDo.txt list were completed. 

If I had more time in a professional environment, I would have finished the task in about 2.5 to 3 hours in total. If you have any questions about this submission, email me at michaelbrettbarnett@gmail.com
